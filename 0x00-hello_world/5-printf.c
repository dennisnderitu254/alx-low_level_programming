 * FUNCtiONALITY *
 *
 * 1. The first line of the file is a preprocessor command, indicated by #.
 * This line tells the preprocessor to include the contents of the stdio.h
 * standard input/output header file (this file is provided for you by the compiler).
 *
 * 2. The next line contains the main function. All C programs must have a main function.
 *
 * 3. The main function is where the execution of your program begins.
 *
 * 4. The printf function is used to print output to the screen.
 *
 * 5. The return 0; statement is the "Exit status" of the program.
 * In this case, the main function is saying it is going to return a 0.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1)
