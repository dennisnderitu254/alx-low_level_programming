0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
====================================

Tasks
-----

### 0\. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

mandatory

This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.

-   You can find the source code [here](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rrqNDWjrCWdARnWFLPExPw "here")
-   The variable `n` will store a different value every time you will run this program
-   You don't have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code
-   The output of the program should be:
    -   The number, followed by
        -   if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
        -   if the number is 0: `is zero`
        -   if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    -   followed by a new line

### 1\. The last digit

mandatory

This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

-   You can find the source code [here](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/5HWhPDsq3jq1yCRQFrLl4Q "here")
-   The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program
-   You don't have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, and `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code
-   The output of the program should be:
-   The string `Last digit of`, followed by
-   `n`, followed by
-   the string `is`, followed by
    -   if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
    -   if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
    -   if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
-   followed by a new line

-   You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc...) is forbidden)
-   All your code should be in the `main` function
-   You can only use `putchar` twice in your code
