Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.

    Prototype: ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters);
    where letters is the number of letters it should read and print
    returns the actual number of letters it could read and print
    if the file can not be opened or read, return 0
    if filename is NULL return 0
    if write fails or does not write the expected amount of bytes, return 0

Requiescat
by Oscar Wilde

Tread lightly, she is near
Under the snow,
Speak gently, she can hear
The daisies grow.

All her bright golden hair
Tarnished with rust,
She that was young and fair
Fallen to dust.

Lily-like, white as snow,
She hardly knew
She was a woman, so
Sweetly she grew.

Coffin-board, heavy stone,
Lie on her breast,
I vex my heart alone,
She is at rest.

Peace, Peace, she cannot hear
Lyre or sonnet,
All my life's buried here,
Heap earth upon it.

Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

Create a function that creates a file.

    Prototype: int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);
    where filename is the name of the file to create and text_content is a NULL terminated string to write to the file
    Returns: 1 on success, -1 on failure (file can not be created, file can not be written, write “fails”, etc…)
    The created file must have those permissions: rw-------. If the file already exists, do not change the permissions.
    if the file already exists, truncate it
    if filename is NULL return -1
    if text_content is NULL create an empty file

Write a function that appends text at the end of a file.

    Prototype: int append_text_to_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);
    where filename is the name of the file and text_content is the NULL terminated string to add at the end of the file
    Return: 1 on success and -1 on failure
    Do not create the file if it does not exist
    If filename is NULL return -1
    If text_content is NULL, do not add anything to the file. Return 1 if the file exists and -1 if the file does not exist or if you do not have the required permissions to write the file

3. cp
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

Write a program that copies the content of a file to another file.

    Usage: cp file_from file_to
    if the number of argument is not the correct one, exit with code 97 and print Usage: cp file_from file_to, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error
    if file_to already exists, truncate it
    if file_from does not exist, or if you can not read it, exit with code 98 and print Error: Can't read from file NAME_OF_THE_FILE, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error
        where NAME_OF_THE_FILE is the first argument passed to your program
    if you can not create or if write to file_to fails, exit with code 99 and print Error: Can't write to NAME_OF_THE_FILE, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error
        where NAME_OF_THE_FILE is the second argument passed to your program
    if you can not close a file descriptor , exit with code 100 and print Error: Can't close fd FD_VALUE, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error
        where FD_VALUE is the value of the file descriptor
    Permissions of the created file: rw-rw-r--. If the file already exists, do not change the permissions
    You must read 1,024 bytes at a time from the file_from to make less system calls. Use a buffer
    You are allowed to use dprintf
